<p>&ldquo;Be More Careful&rdquo;</p>

<p>The implication of this statement is that if your global talent &quot;were &ldquo;more careful&rdquo;, there would be fewer errors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed in your attention to detail&rdquo; The incorrect assumption here is that if your global talent just paid a little bit more attention - they would make fewer mistakes!</p>

<p>That kind of works - but not really.</p>

<p>Do you think airline pilots need a reminder to &ldquo;be more careful&rdquo; or do they just need to run the freaking checklist?</p>

<p>Do you think people who operate heavy equipment need to be constantly reminded to &ldquo;have attention to detail&rdquo; or do they need to have a safety system?</p>

<p>People who need to live in mistake-free environments recognize that having a system is the key to removing errors - not some sort of occasional, useless verbal reminder.</p>

<p>If every lead that comes into your company is worth $1,000 - and your global talent responds &ldquo;97%&rdquo; of the time without typos, that isn&rsquo;t good enough!</p>

<p>The 3% error rate costs you $3000 a month.</p>

<p>Instead of being a lazy boss and manager and saying &ldquo;Be more careful!!!&rdquo; and thinking that you need to replace the person&#8230;. why not pause, and think a little deeper?</p>

<p>Develop a system, instead of just being intellectually lazy.</p>

<p>Maybe you should have prewritten, templated responses saved in CRM. One-click&#8230; perfect email. Zero error rate.</p>

<p>Maybe you should spend $9 bucks a month, or whatever - and run Grammarly on all of the outbound emails your global talent sends. Zero error rate.</p>

<p> Builds systems, don&rsquo;t just tell people to &ldquo;be more careful&rdquo; You get the idea.</p>

<p>If something has high consequences for a mistake - develop a system.</p>

<p>If mistakes have high consequences, regardless of how frequent they are, it&rsquo;s worth your time to build a system.</p>
